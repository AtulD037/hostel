<p><span>A hostel is a home away from home</span> . Aware of the special needs and requirements of students, who come from far-flung places to this centre of learning, the Panjab University tries to provide them a safe, secure and affordable accommodation. 
    <br>
    There are 7 Residence floors for students on the campus.
    These Halls, which accommodate more than 600 students, are named after eminent men , historical personality and great person Jawaharlal Nehru.
    The JNGEC Hostel take pains to give its students a neat and clean environment and a comfortable place to live in. There are Wardens/Hostel Staff on duty round the clock. Hostel has a dining hall and canteen, several desert and water coolers, a visitors' lounge, and invariably an outdoor court for badminton, volley ball etc. The mess provides a balanced diet at reasonable rates. There is provision for indoor games, LCD TV and music system. Internet connectivity through wi-fi been provided in hostel.
    <br>
    Architecturally, the hostels are aesthetically laid out with plenty of open space and a lot of greenery. The rooms are comfortable, fitted with fan, lights and hard furniture. Each wing of the hostel has several verandahs and balconies.
    <br>
    Comforts are important but they are not enough. Man is a social animal and needs to interact with others. The resident students are encouraged to participate in cultural and social activities. Colourful evenings of song and dance are not unusual on the campus. Talent shows, dramatics and literary events are organized from time to time. The inmates of a hostel are encouraged to live in harmony, like one big family, lending each other a helping hand whenever required, mutually cooperating to make hostel life a rich and fruitful experience.
    <br>Living in a hostel presupposes high degree of integrity, consciousness, cooperation, tolerance and hard work for a bright future and good image of our institution.
